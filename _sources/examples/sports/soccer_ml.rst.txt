Combination of rating systems and ML methods
============================================
The soccer outcome prediction can be made by utilizing the rating of teams as features for the machine learning classifiers.
User can also combine rating values with other features (i.e. games statistics). 
There are also two examples for parameters tuning: 1. Tuning Elo system parameters
and 2. Tuning classifier hyper-parameters.
