Rating systems and predictions
==============================
The soccer outcome prediction can be made by turning ratings into predicitions.
AppRATE provides two different methods. 
The first method takes into account the rankings while the second computes
the probability of each outcome.
In this example, we assess the predictive performance of each rating system with two different prediciton methods. 
The target class is the final outcome of soccer matches in the English Premier League (2009-2018 seasons). 
For the predictions we apply the walk-forward procedure.
